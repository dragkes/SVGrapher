# SVGrapher

## Description
SVGrapher is a special tool that is used to build  a weighted graph from a building plan. The graph is used to find the shortest path between two points in the building. The graph is built from a building plan that is given in an SVG file. The output of the program is a graph adjacency matrix that shows the relations between different vertexes.

The program is not finished yet.
